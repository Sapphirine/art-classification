##EE6896 Final Project: Understanding Chinese and Western Art with CNN, BOV and PLSA

 The goal for this project is to classify Western and Chinese artworks using CNN architectures such as ResNets. The framework utilizes a network previously trained on ImageNet with 1000 classes of objects and was fine-tuned to identify the artist (Western art) or the era (Chinese art) of a set of artworks.
 
 
Models can be found in the respective jupyternotebook
